Go was build to increase productivity by enabling rapid prototyping, decreasing compile and build time, and enabling better dependency management.

Go provides net/http package, which is sufficient for creating http clients and servers. We will be learning about:-
1. creation of http servers
2. creation of tcp servers

steps:
1. First we will be creating simple http and tcp servers
2. Then we will be adding authentication, optimizing the server response, defining multiple routes, and logging the http request

Concepts and keywords:
1. Go handlers
2. goroutines
3. Gorilla = A web toolkit for go
